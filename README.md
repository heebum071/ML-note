# ML Note

I am a newbie to machine learning. This is an itinerary of my learning curve on ML. Any comments and suggestions welcome.

Useful links (mostly from statistician)

1) Nice overview of high dimensional statistics <br/> 
by [Martin Wainwright](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/?_ga=2.18494076.435531114.1573686806-1909242507.1563054461) <br/>
- My first step to understand what is theoretical guarantee when p>>n  <br/>
- Who knows asymptotic theory from 1st year Ph.D. econometrics course can learn what makes sense when p>>n (in my opinion...) <br/>

His book for the 1st year Ph.D. (in statistics). Counterparty to Van der vaart's asymptotic statistics.<br/>

2) Statistician's view on high dimensioinal statistics in Economics <br/>
by [Larry Wasserman](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/) <br/>
- (Digression) Don't bring OLS results to serious statistician. They will not belive your t-stat if you do not correct the randomness of your covariates X. <br/>

3) Nice video lecture on statistical machine learning<br/>
by [Ryan Tibshirani](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statml/)<br/>
- If I were to get to know it before Ph.D.. <br/>
[a link](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statml/) <br/> <br/>

4) What is causal in machine learning?<br/>
- The topic where economists can be loud <br/>
- I hope more interactions happen between (Applied) economists and (Causal) machine learners <br/>

5) Econ class for causality and machine learning <br/>
by [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/) <br/>
- Anybody who wants to apply Online-Learning (such as Bandit) to Finance. Glad to talk about it! <br/>

6) Nice textual analysis course <br/>
by [Justin Grimmer](https://www.justingrimmer.org/) <br/>
- Hope someone make a similar lecture in finance research.. Or my bucket list.. <br/>
